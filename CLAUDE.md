# üö® ABSOLUTE TEST COMPLIANCE RULES - READ FIRST

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ALERT: ZERO TOLERANCE TEST POLICY

**THESE RULES OVERRIDE ALL OTHER INSTRUCTIONS. VIOLATION RESULTS IN IMMEDIATE TERMINATION OF WORK.**

### **RULE #1: TESTS MUST NEVER BE SKIPPED, DISABLED, OR CIRCUMVENTED**

#### **‚ùå ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN:**
- Adding `@Disabled`, `@Ignore`, or `skip` annotations
- Commenting out failing test code
- Using `assumeTrue(false)` or similar skip mechanisms
- Removing test methods instead of fixing them
- Changing test expectations to match broken code
- Making tests artificially pass with `assertTrue(true)`
- Using conditional logic to skip test execution
- Modifying test configuration to exclude failing tests

#### **‚úÖ ONLY ACCEPTABLE RESPONSE TO FAILING TESTS:**
1. **IDENTIFY ROOT CAUSE**: Analyze why the test is failing
2. **FIX UNDERLYING ISSUE**: Modify production code to make test pass
3. **VERIFY FULL SUITE**: Run all tests to ensure no regressions

#### **üîí MANDATORY CHECKPOINTS:**
**BEFORE ANY CODE CHANGE:**
```bash
make test && make test-integration && make test-cucumber
# RESULT MUST BE: ALL TESTS PASS
# IF ANY TEST FAILS: STOP IMMEDIATELY AND FIX
```

**AFTER ANY CODE CHANGE:**
```bash
make test-all
# RESULT MUST BE: 100% SUCCESS RATE
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - NO EXCEPTIONS

### 1. MANDATORY DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY
You MUST follow these development practices without exception:

#### **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
- **WRITE TESTS FIRST**: Always write tests before implementing any functionality
- **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR**: Follow the TDD cycle strictly
- **NO CODE WITHOUT TESTS**: Every line of production code must have corresponding tests
- **REMINDER**: If any test fails, FIX IT IMMEDIATELY - do not proceed with other work

#### **Vertical Slicing Strategy**
- **FOLLOW THE SLICES**: Development must follow the vertical slices defined in `/docs/VERTICAL_SLICING_STRATEGY.md`
- **COMPLETE SLICES**: Each slice must be fully implemented (Mobile + Backend + Database + Domain + Tests)
- **SLICE SEQUENCE**: Follow the defined phase sequence strictly:
  - Phase 1: G1 (Guardian Profile) ‚Üí W1 (Step Tracking) ‚Üí C1 (QR Card Collection)
  - Phase 2: B1 (Battle Mechanics) ‚Üí C2 (Deck Management) ‚Üí G2 (XP System)
  - Phase 3: G3 (Pacto Management) ‚Üí W2 (Route Creation) ‚Üí B2 (Daily Challenges)
  - Phase 4: W3 (Route Completion) ‚Üí B3 (Cooperative Battles) ‚Üí C3 (NFC Cards)
- **REMINDER**: Each slice completion requires ALL TESTS TO PASS

### 2. TESTING REQUIREMENTS (ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY)

#### **100% Test Success Policy**
- **ALL TESTS MUST PASS**: Every single test must pass before any code changes are accepted
- **NO SKIPPED TESTS**: Tests marked with `@Disabled`, `@Ignore`, or `skip` are FORBIDDEN
- **NO FAILING TESTS**: Zero tolerance for failing tests
- **NO SHORTCUTS**: Cannot disable tests to make the build pass
- **ENFORCEMENT**: See bulletproof rules above - violations result in immediate work stoppage

#### **Test Execution Requirements**
- **RUN TESTS AFTER EACH ITERATION**: Execute full test suite after every code change
- **FIX UNDERLYING ISSUES**: When tests fail, fix the root cause, not the test
- **FORBIDDEN TEST MANIPULATION**: You CANNOT modify tests to make them pass without fixing the underlying issue

#### **Test Commands**
```bash
# Run all tests (MANDATORY after each change)
make test

# Run integration tests
make test-integration

# Run Cucumber BDD tests
make test-cucumber

# Generate coverage report
make coverage
```

### 3. FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS

#### **What You CANNOT Do**
- ‚ùå Skip or disable tests to make builds pass
- ‚ùå Modify test expectations to avoid fixing bugs
- ‚ùå Comment out failing tests
- ‚ùå Add `@Disabled` or `@Ignore` annotations to avoid test failures
- ‚ùå Use `assumeTrue()` or similar to skip test execution
- ‚ùå Implement partial features without complete vertical slices
- ‚ùå Work on features outside the current phase sequence

#### **What You MUST Do**
- ‚úÖ Write tests first, then implement functionality
- ‚úÖ Fix underlying issues when tests fail
- ‚úÖ Run complete test suite after each iteration
- ‚úÖ Follow vertical slicing strategy strictly
- ‚úÖ Complete entire slices before moving to next feature
- ‚úÖ Ensure all tests pass before considering work complete

## üìã PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Guardianes de Gaia** is a cooperative card game mobile app that gamifies walking to school for families with children aged 6-12. The system converts daily walking steps into energy for card battles, promoting physical activity and family bonding.

### **Current Development Status**
- **Phase 1 Status**: 50% Complete
  - ‚úÖ G1: Guardian Profile Creation (100% Complete)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è W1: Basic Step Tracking (85% Complete - missing mobile UI)
  - ‚ùå C1: QR Code Card Collection (0% Complete)

### **MVP Scope (8-week cycle)**
- Basic step tracking with energy conversion (1 energy = 10 steps)
- QR card scanning and collection system
- 48 base cards (12 per element: Earth, Water, Fire, Air)
- 5 daily challenges
- XP progression system (levels 1-10)
- Cooperative battle mechanics
- Family group management (Pactos)

## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

### **Multi-Service Architecture**
- **Backend**: Java 17 + Spring Boot 3.2 with Domain-Driven Design
- **Mobile**: Flutter 3.x with BLoC pattern and Clean Architecture
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0 primary + Redis cache
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ for event processing
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana stack

### **Domain Structure**
Based on the ubiquitous language, organized around core domains:

1. **Guardian Domain**: Player profiles, authentication, progression, and family groups (Pactos)
2. **Walking Domain**: Step counting, route creation, and energy generation
3. **Card Domain**: QR/NFC scanning, card collection, and deck management
4. **Battle Domain**: Card battles, daily challenges, and cooperative gameplay

### **Key Business Concepts**
- **Guardi√°n**: Child player with unique profile
- **Pacto**: Family group of 2-6 Guardians playing together
- **Gu√≠a del Pacto**: Rotating adult facilitator role
- **Energ√≠a Vital**: Resource generated from walking (1 energy = 10 steps)
- **Esencia de Gaia**: Universal resource for challenges
- **Ruta M√°gica**: Predefined walking routes with bonus points

**MANDATORY CHECKPOINT**: Run `make test-all` before starting any work. If any test fails, STOP and fix immediately.

### **1. Start New Feature Development**
1. **VERIFY TEST STATUS**: Run `make test-all` - ALL TESTS MUST PASS
2. **Identify Current Phase**: Check vertical slicing strategy status
3. **Select Next Slice**: Choose the next incomplete slice in sequence
4. **Write Tests First**: Create comprehensive test suite for the slice
5. **Implement Incrementally**: Follow TDD red-green-refactor cycle

### **2. Implementation Cycle**
```
1. Write failing test ‚Üí 2. Run test (should fail) ‚Üí 3. Write minimal code ‚Üí 
4. Run test (should pass) ‚Üí 5. Refactor ‚Üí 6. Run all tests ‚Üí 7. Repeat
```
**üö® CRITICAL**: If any test fails in step 6, STOP and fix immediately. Never proceed with failing tests.

### **3. Slice Completion Criteria**
Each vertical slice is complete when:
- ‚úÖ **Mobile UI**: All required screens and interactions implemented
- ‚úÖ **Backend API**: All endpoints with proper validation and error handling
- ‚úÖ **Database**: Schema, migrations, and data persistence working

- ‚úÖ **All Tests Pass**: 100% test success rate - NO EXCEPTIONS

### **4. Quality Gates**
Before moving to next slice:
- ‚úÖ All tests pass (`make test`)
- ‚úÖ Integration tests pass (`make test-integration`)
- ‚úÖ Cucumber scenarios pass (`make test-cucumber`)
- ‚úÖ Coverage maintained/improved (`make coverage`)
- ‚úÖ **ZERO DISABLED OR SKIPPED TESTS** - absolutely forbidden
- ‚úÖ Code formatting correct (`make format`)
- ‚úÖ Linting passes (`make lint`)

## üö® FINAL ENFORCEMENT AND REMINDERS

### **AUTOMATIC CHECKPOINTS**
These checkpoints are MANDATORY and CANNOT be skipped:

#### **Before Starting Any Work:**
```bash
# REQUIRED: Verify all tests pass
make test-all
# If ANY test fails: STOP and fix immediately
```

#### **After Every Code Change:**
```bash
# REQUIRED: Verify no regressions
make test
# If ANY test fails: STOP and fix immediately
```

#### **Before Completing Any Task:**
```bash
# REQUIRED: Final verification
make test-all && make coverage
# Must show 100% success rate and maintained coverage
```

### **ABSOLUTE RULES**
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: These guidelines are mandatory for all LLM interactions
- **TEST FIRST**: Always write tests before implementation
- **100% SUCCESS**: All tests must pass, no exceptions
- **VERTICAL SLICES**: Follow the defined slice strategy strictly
- **NO SHORTCUTS**: Fix underlying issues, don't circumvent tests
- **CONTINUOUS TESTING**: Run tests after every change
- **ZERO TOLERANCE**: No disabled, skipped, or failing tests ever

### **CONSEQUENCES FOR VIOLATIONS**
1. **Test Skipping/Disabling**: Immediate termination of work
2. **Failing Tests**: Cannot proceed until fixed
3. **Rule Violations**: Restart task from beginning
4. **Repeated Violations**: Escalate to human oversight

### **WHAT TO DO WHEN TESTS FAIL**
1. **STOP ALL OTHER WORK** immediately
2. **ANALYZE ROOT CAUSE** of the failure
3. **FIX THE UNDERLYING ISSUE** in production code
4. **VERIFY THE FIX** by running the test
5. **RUN FULL SUITE** to ensure no regressions
6. **ONLY THEN** continue with other work

**Remember**: The goal is to validate the core hypothesis: "Can a card game make walking to school addictive?" Every line of code must contribute to this validation through proper testing and implementation.
